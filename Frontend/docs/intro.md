# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book will teach you how to develop intelligent humanoid robots using cutting-edge technologies including ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## What You'll Learn

- How to work with the Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) for humanoid control
- Creating digital twins with Gazebo and Unity simulation
- Implementing AI-brain systems with NVIDIA Isaac for perception and navigation
- Developing Vision-Language-Action systems for natural robot interaction
- Building autonomous humanoid systems with practical examples

## Book Structure

This book is organized into four core modules:

##  How All Modules Connect

All four modules build a complete humanoid robotics pipeline:

- **ROS 2 →** Nervous system  
- **Gazebo/Unity →** Digital twin  
- **NVIDIA Isaac →** AI brain  
- **VLA →** Natural language autonomy  

Together, these systems form an end-to-end framework for designing advanced humanoid robots.
