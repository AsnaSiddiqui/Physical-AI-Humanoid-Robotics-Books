# Navigation with Isaac Sim and ROS

This chapter covers implementing navigation systems using Isaac Sim and ROS. It explores how to leverage Isaac Sim's realistic environments and physics for developing and testing navigation algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up navigation in Isaac Sim environments
- Configure navigation stacks for humanoid robots
- Test navigation algorithms in simulation
- Transfer navigation solutions from simulation to reality

## Navigation in Robotics

Navigation is a fundamental capability for mobile robots, enabling them to move autonomously from one location to another while avoiding obstacles. In humanoid robotics, navigation becomes more complex due to the robot's form factor and mobility constraints.
