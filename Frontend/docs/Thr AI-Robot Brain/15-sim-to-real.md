# Sim-to-Real Transfer Techniques

This chapter covers techniques for transferring skills and behaviors learned in simulation to real robots. This is a critical step in robotics development that allows for safe and efficient training in virtual environments.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the sim-to-real transfer problem
- Learn domain randomization techniques
- Explore robust control strategies for sim-to-real transfer
- Validate transfer performance on real hardware

## The Sim-to-Real Gap

The sim-to-real gap refers to the differences between simulated and real environments that can cause policies trained in simulation to fail when deployed on real robots. Addressing this gap is essential for practical robotics applications.
