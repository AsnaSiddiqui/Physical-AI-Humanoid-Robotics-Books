# Isaac ROS Perception Pipelines

This chapter explores Isaac ROS perception pipelines, which provide accelerated computer vision capabilities for robotics applications. These pipelines leverage NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate perception tasks like object detection, segmentation, and depth estimation.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Isaac ROS perception packages
- Set up perception pipelines with Isaac ROS
- Integrate perception outputs with ROS 2 nodes
- Optimize perception performance using GPU acceleration

## Isaac ROS Perception Overview

Isaac ROS is a collection of hardware-accelerated perception and navigation packages that bridge the gap between NVIDIA's robotics platform and the Robot Operating System (ROS). These packages provide significant performance improvements for perception tasks.
