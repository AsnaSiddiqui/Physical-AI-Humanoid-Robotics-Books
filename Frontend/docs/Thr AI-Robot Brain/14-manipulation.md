# Manipulation with Isaac Sim

This chapter explores robotic manipulation using Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS. It covers how to simulate and control robotic arms and hands for grasping and manipulation tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up manipulation environments in Isaac Sim
- Configure robotic arms for manipulation tasks
- Implement grasping algorithms in simulation
- Transfer manipulation skills from simulation to reality

## Manipulation in Robotics

Robotic manipulation involves the control of robotic systems to interact with objects in the environment. For humanoid robots, manipulation capabilities are essential for performing tasks that require dexterity and precise control.
