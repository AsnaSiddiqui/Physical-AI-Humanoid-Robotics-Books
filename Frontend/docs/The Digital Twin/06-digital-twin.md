# Introduction to Digital Twin Concepts

This chapter introduces the concept of digital twins in robotics, which are virtual replicas of physical robots used for simulation, testing, and optimization. Digital twins play a crucial role in developing and validating robotic systems before deployment.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of digital twins in robotics
- Learn the benefits of using digital twins
- Explore the relationship between physical and virtual robots
- Understand the role of digital twins in the development lifecycle

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system across its lifecycle. In robotics, it's a virtual model of a robot that mirrors the physical robot's characteristics, behaviors, and responses to various stimuli.
