# SDF/URDF Integration in Simulation

This chapter covers the integration of URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and SDF (Simulation Description Format) for robot simulation. Understanding both formats is crucial for creating accurate simulation models.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the differences between URDF and SDF
- Convert URDF to SDF for simulation
- Add simulation-specific properties to robot models
- Validate simulation models

## URDF vs SDF

While URDF is primarily used for representing robot models in ROS, SDF (Simulation Description Format) is used by Gazebo for simulation purposes. SDF can represent more complex environments and includes additional simulation-specific properties.
