# Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)

This chapter explores how to simulate various sensors in Gazebo, including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs. Accurate sensor simulation is essential for developing and testing perception algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

- Add LiDAR sensors to robot models
- Simulate depth cameras in Gazebo
- Configure IMU sensors for simulation
- Validate sensor data in simulation

## Sensor Simulation in Robotics

Sensor simulation is a critical component of robotic simulation environments. It allows developers to test perception algorithms, navigation systems, and other sensor-dependent functionalities without access to physical hardware.
