# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

This capstone chapter integrates all concepts learned throughout the book to build an autonomous humanoid robot system. This project demonstrates the application of ROS 2, simulation, AI, and vision-language-action systems in a cohesive robotic system.

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate all components learned in previous modules
- Build a complete autonomous humanoid system
- Test the system in simulation and (optionally) on real hardware
- Evaluate the performance of the integrated system

## Project Overview

The capstone project involves creating an autonomous humanoid robot capable of receiving voice commands, navigating to specified locations, recognizing and manipulating objects, and responding to dynamic environmental conditions.
