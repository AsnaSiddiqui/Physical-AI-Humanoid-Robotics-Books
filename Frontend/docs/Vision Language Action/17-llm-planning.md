# Planning Using Large Language Models

This chapter covers using Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level task planning in robotics. LLMs can interpret natural language commands and generate executable plans for robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand LLM-based planning approaches
- Integrate LLMs with robotic planning systems
- Convert natural language to robotic action sequences
- Handle planning uncertainty and validation

## LLMs in Robotic Planning

Large Language Models offer a promising approach to robotic planning by enabling robots to understand natural language commands and generate appropriate action sequences. This bridges the gap between human communication and robotic execution.
