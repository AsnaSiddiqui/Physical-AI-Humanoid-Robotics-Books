# Conversational Robotics

This chapter explores conversational robotics, focusing on building robots that can engage in natural conversations with humans. This involves integrating speech recognition, natural language understanding, and dialogue management.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement conversational interfaces for robots
- Design dialogue systems for human-robot interaction
- Integrate conversational capabilities with robotic actions
- Evaluate conversational robot performance

## Conversational Interfaces in Robotics

Conversational interfaces enable more natural and intuitive human-robot interaction. For humanoid robots, conversational capabilities are essential for applications in customer service, healthcare, education, and other human-centric environments.
