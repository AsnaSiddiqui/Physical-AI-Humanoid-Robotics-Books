# Vision-Language-Action Systems

This chapter covers building integrated Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that combine visual perception, language understanding, and robotic action. These systems enable robots to understand and respond to complex, multimodal commands.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand VLA system architecture
- Integrate vision, language, and action components
- Implement multimodal perception for robotics
- Evaluate VLA system performance

## Vision-Language-Action Integration

Vision-Language-Action systems represent a significant advancement in robotics, enabling robots to perceive their environment, understand natural language commands, and execute appropriate actions in a coordinated manner.
