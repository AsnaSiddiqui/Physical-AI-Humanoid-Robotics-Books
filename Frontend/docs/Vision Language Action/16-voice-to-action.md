# Whisper Voice Commands for Robotics

This chapter explores implementing voice-to-action systems using OpenAI's Whisper for robotics applications. Voice interfaces provide a natural way for humans to interact with robots.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up Whisper for voice recognition in robotics
- Process voice commands for robotic actions
- Integrate voice recognition with ROS 2
- Handle voice command validation and error recovery

## Voice Interfaces in Robotics

Voice interfaces enable natural human-robot interaction, allowing users to control robots using spoken commands. This is particularly useful for humanoid robots designed to interact with humans in various environments.
