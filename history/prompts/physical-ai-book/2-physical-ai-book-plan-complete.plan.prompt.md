## Prompt

```text
Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Docusaurus book
Purpose: Turn the business requirements and /sp.specify into a technical plan that covers architecture, section layout, research approach, quality validation, documented decisions, and testing strategy. Organized by phases: Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis. Follow APA citations (per /sp.constitution) and use a research-concurrent workflow.

1) Architecture sketch (high-level)

Authoring layer

Claude + Spec-Kit Plus orchestrator (prompt-driven generation)

Subagents (only for assigned domains):

research-expert — produces technical content & source lists

tech-docs-writer — converts content → Docusaurus Markdown

seo-web-optimizer — generates metadata (title, slug, description, keywords)

quality-validator — final approval checks

Skills (invoked by orchestrator for specific tasks):

content-architect — book structure, sidebar, chapter breakdown

documentation-website-builder — filesystem + config (sidebar.js, docusaurus.config.js)

style-&-consistency-editor — formatting, terminology, style polishing

Build & CI layer

Local / CI runner that builds Docusaurus site (yarn build) and runs tests (link-checker, markdown-lint, code snippet execution where applicable)

Validation & QA

Automated checks (link/SEO/meta checks, code snippet linting) + manual reviews by quality-validator

Publish

GitHub repo with Docusaurus structure → GitHub Pages deployment (branch: gh-pages)

2) Section structure (mapped to Docusaurus)

Root docs folder:

/docs
  /module-1-ros2
    01-intro-physical-ai.md
    02-ros2-architecture.md
    03-rclpy.md
    04-urdf-xacro.md
    05-agent-integration.md
  /module-2-digital-twin
    06-digital-twin.md
    07-gazebo-basics.md
    08-urdf-sdf-sim.md
    09-sensor-simulation.md
    10-unity-visualization.md
  /module-3-isaac
    11-isaac-intro.md
    12-isaac-ros-perception.md
    13-nav2.md
    14-manipulation.md
    15-sim-to-real.md
  /module-4-vla

    17-llm-planning.md
    18-vla-systems.md
    19-conversational-robotics.md
    20-capstone.md


Each chapter file must contain front-matter per spec:

---
title: "Chapter Title"
description: "SEO-friendly description"
slug: /module-x/chapter-y
tags: [...]
---


Sidebar generated by documentation-website-builder using content-architect outputs.

3) Research approach (research-concurrent)

Principle: Research happens in small increments while writing each chapter (not an up-front monolith).

Per-chapter flow

content-architect defines chapter outline & checklist (learning outcomes, examples, required assets).

research-expert performs focused research for that chapter (collects 5–10 sources, prioritizing official docs and recent papers), returns: facts, citations (APA), and key quotes ≤25 words.

tech-docs-writer drafts the chapter from research-expert content (markdown + runnable code blocks).

seo-web-optimizer attaches front-matter metadata.

style-&-consistency-editor polishes text and formatting.

quality-validator runs acceptance validation (see §5) and approves or rejects with issues.

Source management

research-expert provides an APA-style source block at the end of each chapter.

Maintain a central sources.yaml per module (for traceability).

Citation rule: Every factual or numerical claim must have a citation. Use inline parenthetical APA or footnote links.

4) Quality validation (checks + actors)

Automated checks (CI)

Markdown linting (markdownlint)

Spell/grammar check (language tool)

Link-checker (no broken links)

Front-matter presence and SEO fields (slug, description, tags)

Code block syntax highlighting & language annotation

Executable checks for short ROS 2 snippets (static validation only)

Human checks

quality-validator does a checklist review: factual accuracy (cross-check with sources), scope compliance (module boundary), clarity/readability, and plagiarism scan.

style-&-consistency-editor ensures consistent terminology (e.g., "ROS 2" formatting, URDF naming).

Acceptance criteria (per chapter)

All claims have ≥1 source (APA).

Code snippets compile/parse (where applicable).

Front matter filled and SEO metadata present.

No broken links.

Approved by quality-validator.

5) Decisions needing documentation (choices, options, tradeoffs)

For each decision, capture options and tradeoffs in /docs/decisions/*.md.

Simulation Platform Choice for Examples

Options: Gazebo-only, Gazebo+Unity, Isaac Sim examples

Tradeoffs: Gazebo = open & ROS-native; Unity = high-fidelity visuals but extra tooling; Isaac Sim = photoreal & synthetic data but GPU/RTX requirements.

Hydra vs Cloud Emphasis

Options: Focus on local RTX workstations vs Cloud-first (AWS/NVIDIA Omniverse)

Tradeoffs: Local = reproducible, high cost per student; Cloud = accessible, recurring cost & latency.

Code Execution in Docs

Options: Provide runnable instructions only vs include scripts + CI-run examples

Tradeoffs: Runnable improves reproducibility but increases CI complexity.

Scope of VLA Integrations

Options: Conceptual + pseudo-code vs full Whisper + GPT integration demos

Tradeoffs: Full integration is compelling but needs API access and more infra; pseudo-code is lower-risk.

Synthetic Data Strategy

Options: Domain randomization vs photorealistic synthetic pipelines

Tradeoffs: Domain randomization generalizes; photorealistic requires GPU and Isaac Sim.

Each decision item must be recorded and assigned an owner (content-architect or research-expert) and sign-off from quality-validator.

6) Testing strategy (validation checks mapped to acceptance criteria)

Unit-level content tests

Front-matter present, slug correct, SEO tags exist.

Chapter wordcount within 800–1500 words (warn if outside).

Technical sample tests

Lint ROS 2 code examples for syntax.

For Bash/commands, run static parse tests in CI.

For Python code blocks, run python -m py_compile on extracted snippets where feasible.

Research & citation tests

Verify each citation is present in sources.yaml and on-chapter APA block.

Random sampling check: quality-validator cross-checks 20% of sources per module.

Site build tests

yarn build must complete without error in CI.

Link-checker must return zero broken links.

SEO metadata verification: meta description length check, uniqueness per chapter.

End-to-end capstone smoke test

Run through capstone README: simulate commands and verify that the described pipeline can be followed in principle (not full hardware run).

Approval gates

A chapter only merges to main after:

All automated checks pass

style-&-consistency-editor signoff

quality-validator approval

7) Phase plan & deliverables (Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis)
Phase A — Research (weeks 1–2, concurrent per chapter)

Deliverables:

Module-wise sources.yaml (by research-expert)

Chapter outlines (content-architect)

Decision log entries for major choices

Phase B — Foundation (weeks 2–5)

Deliverables:

First drafts of core chapters (tech-docs-writer)

Docusaurus folder + sidebar (documentation-website-builder)

SEO front-matter for published drafts (seo-web-optimizer)

Phase C — Analysis (weeks 5–8)

Deliverables:

Polished chapter drafts (style-&-consistency-editor)

Automated CI checks green

Unit technical validation reports

Phase D — Synthesis (weeks 8–10)

Deliverables:

Finalized book site build (yarn build)

quality-validator final report

Deployment to GitHub Pages

Timing is adjustable; keep research-concurrent so chapters move from Research→Foundation→Analysis→Synthesis independently.

8) Subagent & Skill usage matrix (enforced)

content-architect (Skill) → only for: book structure, chapter outlines, Docusaurus sidebar.

research-expert (Subagent) → only for: sourcing, technical facts, evidence, APA citations, facts.yaml.

tech-docs-writer (Subagent) → only for: transforming research into Docusaurus markdown + code blocks.

seo-web-optimizer (Subagent) → only for: title, slug, meta description, keywords, tag taxonomy.

documentation-website-builder (Skill) → only for: generating folder structure, sidebar.js, config files.

style-&-consistency-editor (Skill) → only for: style, grammar, naming consistency, formatting fixes.

quality-validator (Subagent) → only for: final QA, acceptance checks, sign-off.

Enforcement rule: Every generated chapter must carry metadata: generated_by: [subagent] and checked_by: [skill/subagent] in an internal audit comment. The orchestrator must refuse to use a subagent outside its assigned domain.

9) Artifacts to store in repo

/docs — Docusaurus content

/decisions — decision logs (markdown)

/sources — sources.yaml per module, plus APA blocks per chapter

/ci — build & test scripts

/audit — per-chapter audit JSON (who generated, who edited, QA status)

sidebar.js, docusaurus.config.js, package.json

10) Next immediate actions (what to run now)

Run content-architect to produce chapter checklists and sidebar skeleton.

Assign research-expert to Module 1: collect 8 authoritative sources and produce sources.yaml and a 1-paragraph summary per chapter.

documentation-website-builder create /docs/module-1-ros2 folder and stub files with front-matter.

Post stubs through pipeline (tech-docs-writer → style editor → quality-validator) for an initial demo chapter.
```

## Response snapshot

I have successfully generated the `plan.md` file for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" feature.

**Branch Name**: `1-physical-ai-book`
**Implementation Plan Path**: `specs/1-physical-ai-book/plan.md`
**Generated Artifacts**:
- `specs/1-physical-ai-book/spec.md`
- `specs/1-physical-ai-book/checklists/requirements.md`
- `specs/1-physical-ai-book/plan.md`

The plan is complete and outlines the technical approach, section structure, research approach, quality validation, decisions needing documentation, testing strategy, phase plan, subagent/skill usage matrix, and artifacts to be stored in the repository. The next immediate actions are also clearly defined within the plan itself.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Detailed implementation plan generated for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" feature.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created specs/1-physical-ai-book/plan.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next immediate actions are outlined in the plan itself, including using `content-architect`, `research-expert`, and `documentation-website-builder` skills/subagents.
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan successfully integrates the user's detailed input, adhering to the specified structure and principles. The manual creation of the PHR was necessary due to script output issues.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PHR script failed, manual creation performed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Improve robustness of PHR script in PowerShell.
